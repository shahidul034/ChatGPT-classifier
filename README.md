## https://shahidul034.github.io/ChatGPT-classifier/

## Overview
This code is a JavaScript function that utilizes the Hugging Face API to classify text as either "YES" or "NO". The classification is based on the scores of two text inputs, one generated by a human and the other by an AI model. The API used is a Hugging Face model called "chatGPT_classifier".

## Functionality
The `displayDate()` function is triggered by a button click and takes the user input from a text field with the ID "inputText". It then sends the input to the Hugging Face API using the `query()` function, which returns a JSON object containing the scores for both the human and AI-generated texts. The function then compares these scores and displays "NO" if the human text has a higher score and "YES" if the AI-generated text has a higher score. 

## Dependencies
This code requires an internet connection to access the Hugging Face API. It also requires the `fetch()` function to send and receive data to and from the API.

## Authorization
The API requires an authorization token for authentication. The token used in this code is a bearer token provided by Hugging Face.

## How to Use
To use this code, simply copy the script into your HTML file and add a button with an `onclick` attribute set to `displayDate()`. You will also need to create an input field with the ID "inputText" and two HTML elements with the IDs "output" and "output2" to display the classification and score information, respectively.
